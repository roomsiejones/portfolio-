## Description

The goal of this project was to create a mock portfolio page.

This can be the starting point once cleaned up to creating a portfolio page to showcase projects you've completed. 

When you load the portfolio page, you'll see a recent profile picture, the developer's name, links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.

When you click the links in the section, the browser or user interface will scroll to the corresponding section.

When you click the links or image cards under work, it'll open the work in a new page. 

The image size of the project you wish to highlight the most is larger than the others.

When you resize the page, it is in a semi-responsive format that should be developed further. 

## Process

Started with baseline html and created containers using a mock-design

Added reset.css and baseline style.css sheets.

Added updates to html, creating more containers when necessary.

Utilized dev tools to troubleshoot certain stylings.

Added some comments in code for readablility.
